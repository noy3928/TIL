HTTP/3 headers are used to convey information about the request or response being transmitted, such as the type of content being sent, the encoding used, and the location of the resource being requested.

In HTTP/3, headers are formatted and encoded using HPACK (Header Compression for HTTP/2), which is a compression algorithm designed to reduce the size of headers and improve the efficiency of data transmission.

HTTP/3 also uses a framing layer to structure the data being transmitted over the connection. The framing layer defines how data is divided into frames, which are then sent over the connection. Each frame contains a header that specifies the type and length of the data contained in the frame, as well as any flags or other metadata.

The use of a framing layer allows HTTP/3 to support multiplexing, which allows multiple streams of data to be transmitted over a single connection concurrently. This can help to improve the performance of HTTP/3 by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel.

Overall, the use of headers and framing in HTTP/3 helps to improve the efficiency and reliability of data transmission, as well as enabling new features such as multiplexing and flow control.

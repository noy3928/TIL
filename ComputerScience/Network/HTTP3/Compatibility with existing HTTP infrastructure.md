HTTP/3 is designed to be compatible with existing HTTP infrastructure, which means that it can be used with existing servers, clients, and network equipment that support HTTP.

One of the main goals of HTTP/3 was to ensure that it could be deployed without requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure. To achieve this, HTTP/3 was designed to use the same HTTP semantics as previous versions of the protocol, which means that it can be used with existing HTTP applications and APIs.

However, there are some considerations to be aware of when deploying HTTP/3 in an existing infrastructure. For example, some older servers or clients may not support HTTP/3, or may require additional configuration to enable HTTP/3 support. Additionally, there may be performance or compatibility issues with certain network equipment or configurations that do not support HTTP/3.

Overall, HTTP/3 is designed to be compatible with existing HTTP infrastructure, but it may require some additional configuration or testing to ensure that it is deployed smoothly and performs optimally.

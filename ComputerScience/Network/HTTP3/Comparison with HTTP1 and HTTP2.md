HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are previous versions of the HTTP protocol, which are still widely used on the internet. Here is a comparison of some of the main differences between HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3:

-   Multiplexing: HTTP/1 does not support multiplexing, which means that it can only transmit a single request at a time over a connection. HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be transmitted concurrently over a single connection. HTTP/3 builds on this feature with the use of a framing layer, which allows for even more efficient multiplexing.
    
-   Header compression: HTTP/1 does not use any header compression, which can result in large headers that take up a significant amount of bandwidth. HTTP/2 introduced header compression using the HPACK (Header Compression for HTTP/2) algorithm, which can significantly reduce the size of headers and improve the efficiency of data transmission. HTTP/3 also uses HPACK for header compression.
    
-   Transport protocol: HTTP/1 uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as its transport protocol, which provides reliable data transmission but can suffer from high latency. HTTP/2 introduced the option to use TCP or a multiplexed version of TCP called HTTP/2 over TLS (Transport Layer Security). HTTP/3 uses the QUIC transport protocol, which is based on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and provides multiplexing, flow control, encryption, and error correction.
    
-   Compatibility with existing infrastructure: HTTP/3 was designed to be compatible with existing HTTP infrastructure, which means that it can be used with existing servers, clients, and network equipment that support HTTP. HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are also compatible with existing infrastructure, but HTTP/3 includes additional features and improvements that may require some additional configuration or testing to ensure optimal performance.
    

Overall, HTTP/3 represents a significant improvement over previous versions of HTTP in terms of performance, security, and support for modern web applications. While HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are still widely used, HTTP/3 is expected to become more widely adopted over time as more servers and clients support it.

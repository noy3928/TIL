problem :
Imagine you want to create a calculator application that has different features such as addition, subtraction, changing base of the numbers to hexadecimal, decimal, and many other features. But one of your friends is interested in changing the base of his favorite number to Octal base number and you are still developing the application. So, what could be the solution to it? Should your friend check the application daily just to get to know about the status? But don’t you think it would result in a lot of unnecessary visits to the application which were definitely not required. Or you may think about that each time you add the new feature and send the notification to each user. Is it OK? Sometimes yes but not every time. Might be some users get offended by a lot of unnecessary notifications which they really don’t want.

solution :
Let’s discuss the solution to the above-described problem. Here comes the object Subject into the limelight. But it also notifies the other objects also that’s why we generally call it Publisher. All the objects that want to track changes in the publisher’s state are called subscribers.

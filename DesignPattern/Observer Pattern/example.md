A real world example of observer pattern can be any social media platform such as Facebook or twitter. When a person updates his status – all his followers gets the notification.
A follower can follow or unfollow another person at any point of time. Once unfollowed, person will not get the notifications from subject in future.

In programming, observer pattern is the basis of message oriented applications. When a application has updated it’s state, it notifies the subscribers about updates. Frameworks like HornetQ, JMS work on this pattern.
Similarly, Java UI based programming, all keyboard and mouse events are handled by it’s listeners objects and designated functions. When user click the mouse, function subscribed to the mouse click event is invoked with all the context data passed to it as method argument.

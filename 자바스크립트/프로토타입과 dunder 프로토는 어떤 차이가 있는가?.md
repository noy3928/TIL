#프로토타입 #자바스크립트-면접질문 


자바스크립트에서 `prototype` 속성은 생성자함수의 `prototype`을 정의하기 위해서 사용한다. 반면에 `__proto__`속성은 객체의 prototype에 접근하기 위해서 사용된다. 

`prototype` 속성은 생성자함수의 속성이다. 그리고 이 생성자 함수는 생성자를 이용해서 만들어진 객체에 대한 프로토타입 객체를 

The `prototype` property is a property of a constructor function that is used to define the prototype object for the objects created using that constructor. The prototype object is an object that serves as a template for creating new objects, and any properties or methods defined on the prototype are available to all objects created using the constructor.

Here is an example of using the `prototype` property to define the prototype for a constructor function:

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.makeNoise = function() {
  console.log("Some generic animal noise");
};

const animal1 = new Animal("Fluffy");
animal1.makeNoise(); // Output: "Some generic animal noise"
```

In this example, the `Animal` constructor function has a `prototype` property that defines a `makeNoise` method. When an `Animal` object is created using the `new` operator, it inherits the `makeNoise` method from the prototype.

On the other hand, the `__proto__` property is a property of an object that is used to access the prototype of that object. The `__proto__` property is not directly accessible in most modern browsers, but it can be accessed using the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method.

Here is an example of using the `__proto__` property to access the prototype of an object:

```javascript
const animal = {
  makeNoise() {
    console.log("Some generic animal noise");
  }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);

console.log(dog.__proto__ === animal); // Output: true
```

In this example, the `dog` object is created using the `Object.create()` method and is given the `animal` object as its prototype. The `__proto__` property of the `dog` object is then used to access the prototype of the `dog` object, which is the `animal` object.

In general, you should avoid using the `__proto__` property and use the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method instead, as the `__proto__` property is not supported in all browsers and may be removed in the future. The `prototype` property, on the other hand, is a standard part of JavaScript and is used to define the prototype for constructor functions.

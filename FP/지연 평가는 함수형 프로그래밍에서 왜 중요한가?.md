azy evaluation is a technique used in functional programming in which the evaluation of expressions is delayed until they are needed. This can be useful in a number of situations, including the following:

1.  Improving performance: Lazy evaluation allows you to avoid evaluating expressions that may not be needed, which can improve the performance of your program. For example, if you have a long list of values and you only need the first few, lazy evaluation can allow you to stop evaluating the rest of the list once you have found what you need.
    
2.  Deferring the evaluation of expensive computations: If you have a computation that is expensive to perform, you can use lazy evaluation to defer its evaluation until it is needed. This can help to reduce the overall cost of your program.
    
3.  Simplifying the handling of infinite data structures: In functional programming, it is common to work with data structures that may be infinite in size, such as lists that are generated on the fly. Lazy evaluation allows you to work with these data structures without having to worry about evaluating the entire structure at once.
    

Overall, lazy evaluation is an important technique in functional programming because it allows you to write more efficient and expressive code. It allows you to write programs that can handle large amounts of data and perform complex computations, while still maintaining good performance and simplicity.

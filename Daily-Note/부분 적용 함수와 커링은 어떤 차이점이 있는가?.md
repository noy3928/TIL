In JavaScript, a partially applied function is a function that has been called with fewer arguments than it expects. This returns a new function that expects the remaining arguments to be supplied when it is called.

Currying is a way of constructing functions that allows partial application of a function's arguments. When a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, it returns a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This allows you to create a series of functions that each take a single argument, and then combine them to create a new function that takes multiple arguments.

Here is an example of how you might use partial application and currying in JavaScript:
```javascript
// A function that expects three arguments
function greet(greeting, firstName, lastName) {
  return `${greeting}, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;
}

// Create a partially applied function that expects one argument
const greetHello = greet.bind(null, 'Hello');

// Use the partially applied function
console.log(greetHello('John', 'Doe'));  // Output: "Hello, John Doe!"

// Create a curried function that expects one argument
const greetCurried = greeting => firstName => lastName =>
  `${greeting}, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;

// Use the curried function
console.log(greetCurried('Hello')('John')('Doe'));  // Output: "Hello, John Doe!"

```

In the example above, `greetHello` is a partially applied function that expects two arguments, and `greetCurried` is a curried function that expects three arguments. Both functions are equivalent and can be used to greet someone by their first and last name.

One key difference between partially applied functions and curried functions is that partially applied functions are created using the `bind` method, while curried functions are created by returning a series of functions from a function that expects multiple arguments. This allows you to create curried functions that can be called with arguments in any order, while partially applied functions must be called with the remaining arguments in the order in which they were originally defined.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) are both transport protocols that are used to establish a connection between a client and a server for the purpose of transmitting data. However, there are some key differences between the two protocols in terms of how they establish a connection.

One of the main differences between TCP and QUIC is the way in which they establish a connection. In traditional TCP, the process of establishing a connection involves a series of steps known as the "TCP handshake," which includes exchanging SYN (synchronize) and ACK (acknowledge) packets between the client and server. This process can take a significant amount of time, especially in high-latency networks or when there are multiple intermediaries between the client and server.

In contrast, QUIC is designed to establish a connection using a single packet exchange, known as the Initial Packet. The Initial Packet contains the necessary information for the server to establish a connection with the client, including a unique connection identifier (CID) and a set of cryptographic keys for encrypting and authenticating the connection. This allows QUIC to establish a connection much more quickly than TCP, which can reduce latencies and improve the overall performance of the web.

Another difference between TCP and QUIC is the way in which they handle lost or out-of-order packets. TCP uses a retransmission mechanism to ensure that all packets are received correctly by the destination. However, this can add latency to the connection as the sender waits for an acknowledgement from the receiver before sending more packets. QUIC, on the other hand, uses a more efficient loss recovery mechanism that allows it to recover from lost or out-of-order packets more quickly, which can further reduce latencies.

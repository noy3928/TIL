Here are some potential "prototype" questions that you might ask a JavaScript engineer during a coding interview:

1.  Can you explain what the prototype chain is and how it works in JavaScript?
2.  How do you create a new object that inherits from an existing object in JavaScript?
3.  Can you give an example of how you would use the `Object.create()` method to create a new object that inherits from a prototype object?
4.  How do you add a new method to an object's prototype in JavaScript?
5.  Can you explain the difference between using the `prototype` property and using the `Object.create()` method to create a new object that inherits from a prototype object?
6.  How do you override an inherited method in JavaScript?
7.  Can you give an example of how you would use the `instanceof` operator to determine whether an object is an instance of a particular constructor function?
8.  How do you determine if an object has a particular property or method, even if it is not directly on the object itself but is inherited through the prototype chain?

Keep in mind that these are just a few examples of the types of questions you might ask about prototypes in a coding interview with a JavaScript engineer. The specific questions you ask will depend on the skills and experience of the candidate, as well as the specific needs and requirements of your project or team.
